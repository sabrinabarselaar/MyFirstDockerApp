# My First Docker App.

For the purposes of this workshop, we've created a fun little Python Flask app that displays a random cat `.gif` every time it is loaded - because, you know, who doesn't like cats?

>**Note:** This section is in this repository in the [docker-beginners-quide](https://github.com/docker/labs/blob/master/beginner/chapters/webapps) directory.

Now that you have a better understanding of images, it's time to create your own. Our goal here is to create an image that sandboxes a small [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org) application.

**The goal of this exercise is to create a Docker image which will run a Flask app.**

We'll do this by first pulling together the components for a random cat picture generator built with Python Flask, then _dockerizing_ it by writing a _Dockerfile_. Finally, we'll build the image, and then run it.

### Build the image

Now that you have your `Dockerfile`, you can build your image. The `docker build` command does the heavy-lifting of creating a docker image from a `Dockerfile`.

When you run the `docker build` command given below, make sure to replace `<YOUR_USERNAME>` with your username. This username should be the same one you created when registering on [Docker Cloud](https://cloud.docker.com). If you haven't done that yet, please go ahead and create an account.

The `docker build` command is quite simple - it takes an optional tag name with the `-t` flag, and the location of the directory containing the `Dockerfile` - the `.` indicates the current directory:

```
$ docker build -t <YOUR_USERNAME>/myfirstapp .

If you don't have the `alpine:3.5` image, the client will first pull the image and then create your image. Therefore, your output on running the command will look different from mine. If everything went well, your image should be ready! Run `docker images` and see if your image (`<YOUR_USERNAME>/myfirstapp`) shows.

### Run your image
The next step in this section is to run the image and see if it actually works.

```bash
$ docker run -p 8888:5000 --name myfirstapp YOUR_USERNAME/myfirstapp
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

Head over to `http://localhost:8888` and your app should be live. **Note** If you are using Docker Machine, you may need to open up another terminal and determine the container ip address using `docker-machine ip default`.
